        <p>
            please note i had to generalize some information (such as times we've visited), otherwise it would've taken
            me
            way too long.
            <br>
            notes per category:
        <ul>
            <li>
                location: this is generally areas within the GTA. If it's outside of GTA, it will just be the city name
                such
                as Hamilton
            </li>
            <li>
                date visited: this is the date when the specific photo was taken. not necessarily the first or most
                recent
                time we went
            </li>
            <li>
                number of visits: once (1), a couple of times (2-10), or often (10+)
            </li>
            <li>
                cuisine: just the cuisine or the type of store (such as: korean, japanese, chinese, BBT, cafe)
            </li>
            <li>bonus: which day of the week did we visit?</li>
        </ul>
